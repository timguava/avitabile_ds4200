Hi!

The html file you want to look at is called "home.html". It references style.css and gender_d3.js, so make sure you have access to those files too.

The file processed_data_part5.csv is the final processed data file which all the visualizations are built from.

If there are any problems loading the files, please email me at avitabile.t@northeastern.edu.

Thanks!
Tim Avitabile
